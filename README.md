# Reproducible Bioinformatics for Plant Breeding

This repository contains teaching material for a Master’s-level course module on
**bioinformatics for plant breeding**, developed by [**SLUBI**](https://www.slubi.se/)
for [**emPLANT**](https://emplant-master.eu/).

The course introduces core concepts and tools used in modern bioinformatics, with
a focus on **reproducibility** and **quality control of sequencing data**.

## Course overview

The module consists of two main parts:

1. **Reproducible bioinformatics**
   - Data life cycles and FAIR principles
   - File organisation and documentation
   - Literate programming using Markdown
   - Version control
   - Software environments, containers, and workflow managers

2. **Sequencing data quality control**
   - Introduction to raw sequencing data and the need for quality control
   - Common reasons that affect data quality
   - Quality assessment using **FastQC**
   - Understanding and interpreting FastQC reports
