title: "emPLANT Bioinformatics Course"
---

This material is part of the [emPLANT](https://emplant-master.eu/) Bioinformatics Course. 

**emPLANT** is an international Master’s programme that trains students in modern plant breeding and innovative plant sciences, combining academic excellence with practical skills for research and industry.

See the course schedule [here](https://astrocyte.com/EMPLANT2026/index.html). 

In this module we will talk about [reproducibility in bioinformatics analyses](data_management.qmd), which will briefly introduce you to some techniques and tools to make your life easier. 

Then we will take a step back and look at how we can [assess the quality of (short read) sequencing data](qc.qmd). An important step that lays the groundwork to everything else that you will to with your data!
