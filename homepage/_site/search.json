A lot of bioinformatics is not being afraid to try things, and reading the documentation.\nThis traditional way of working with bioinformatics data can have merits and lead to new discoveries. However, in this course we would like to introduce you to a more structured way to make sense of your data.\nLet’s have a look at a typical PhD student’s research project:\n\nThey might analyse their data, and get some results.\nAfter talking with their supervisor they might get a few other samples from a collaborator, or need to drop them from the analyses due to quality concerns.\nThey run the analyses again and get a different set of results.\nThere might be a few iterations of this process, and then the reviewers require some additional analyses…\n\nIn the “end” we have something like this:\n\n\n\nWhich one of these is the latest version?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest practices file organization\n\n\n\n\nThere is a folder for the raw data, which does not get altered.\nCode is kept separate from data.\nUse a version control system (at least for code) – e.g. git.\nThere should be a README in every directory, describing the purpose of the directory and its contents.\nUse file naming schemes that makes it easy to find files and understand what they are (for humans and machines) and document them.\nUse non-proprietary formats – .csv rather than .xlsx",

This is often done with R-scripts, but can just as well be applied to bash scripts, python scripts etc.\nIn the past years, the development went even further and one can even combine code and documentation in the same document.

These tools find and install packages, so that the same package versions are being run between different computers.

Many of the problems we detect during QC originate early in the sequencing workflow.\nAt a high level, the process looks like this:\nPlant tissue → DNA extraction → Library preparation → Sequencing → FASTQ files\nEach step can introduce technical effects that later appear in quality control reports.\n\n\n\n\nWe start with plant tissue and extract DNA into a tube.\n\n\n\n\nThis step looks simple, but plant material often contains compounds that make extraction harder.\n\n\n\n\nCommon plant “contaminants” include:\n\n\n\n\nPolyphenols (can bind to DNA and interfere with enzymes)\n\n\n\n\nPolysaccharides (can make DNA sticky and hard to pipette)\n\n\n\n\nOther impurities (depending on tissue type and extraction method)\n\n\n\n\nIf extraction quality varies between samples, you can end up with differences in sequencing quality that are not biological.\n\n\n\n\nSequencing machines do not read whole chromosomes. Instead, DNA is broken into many small fragments, a so called DNA library.\n\n\n\n\nIf the DNA is already degraded (for example due to poor storage), fragmentation can become uneven.\n\n\n\n\nThat can later lead to: uneven coverage (some regions have very few reads)\n\n\n\n\nor over-representation of certain fragment sizes.\n\n\n\n\nIn QC, this can show up as unusual sequence length distributions or downstream effects on mapping.\n\n\n\n\nThe DNA library (with adapters added), is then run on a sequencing machine.\n\n\n\n\nDuring sequencing:\n\n\n\n\n\nthe machine calls bases one by one\neach base gets a quality score\nquality often decreases toward the end of reads\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final output is usually FASTQ files (containing raw reads + quality scores).\n\n\n\n\nQuality control tools, such as FastQC, can summarise these FASTQ files and helps us spot problems early.",
