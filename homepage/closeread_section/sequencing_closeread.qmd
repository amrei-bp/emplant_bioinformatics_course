::: {#cr-sticky_sampling}
![](../figures/qc/sampling.png)
:::

@cr-sticky_sampling We start with **plant tissue** and extract the contained DNA.  

::: {#cr-sticky_prep}
![](../figures/qc/library_prep.png)
:::

@cr-sticky_prep Next, sequencing machines do not read whole chromosomes. Instead, DNA is broken into **many small fragments**, the so called **DNA library**.

::: {#cr-sticky_seq}
![](../figures/qc/sequencing.png)
:::

@cr-sticky_seq The **DNA library** (with adapters added), is then run on a **sequencing machine**, which calls the bases of each fragment.

The final output are usually **FASTQ files**, which contain raw reads and quality scores.
